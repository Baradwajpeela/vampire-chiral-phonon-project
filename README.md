This is the repository for simulation of spin-dynamics in CGT on CeF3. This project involves stdying ultrfast demagnetization dynamicsin 2D ferromagnets like CGT via THz abbsorption of ultrafast circular pulses by CeF3 which generate large effective B-Fields. This project is developed by Bharadwaj Peela at EQUAL Lab Rice University , contact bp32@rice.edu incase of any queries
